Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm (PA4)
Ferris Prima NUGRAHA
SID: 20543826

How to use:
1. Generate Vertex:
Press Add Vertex and then click white label for position of the new vertex.

2. Generate Edge:
Press add edge, then click one vertex (changed to yellow), click another one 
and enter the desired weight for this edge.

3. Delete vertex or edge:
Right click, make sure to turn off the push buttons.

4. Random Generate (Bonus)
Click the push button, then click desired number of vertex, edge density, 
and maximum allowed weight of edge.


4. Dijkstra Implementation:
   a. Start
      Click start button, click a vertex to be the starting point, will turn 
      blue.

   b. Step by step (Bonus) : not implemented
   
   c. Show Path (Normal, with AVL)
      Click another vertex to be the destination from source. Distance for 
      every vertex from start will be displayed, edges along path will turn blue.

   d. Show Path (Red-Black Tree, Bonus)
      Procedure is basically the same as the normal Show Path.

   d. Clear Path
      Will clear path and also displayed number for each vertex.
      Feel free to add or delete vertex or edges, may also start another dijkstra
      implementation.
